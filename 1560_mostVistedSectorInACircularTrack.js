/*
Given an integer n and an integer array rounds. We have a circular
track which consists of n sectors labeled from 1 to n. A marathon
will be held on this track, the marathon consists of m rounds. The
ith round starts at sector rounds[i - 1] and ends at sector rounds[i]
. For example, round 1 starts at sector rounds[0] and ends at sector
rounds[1]

// Input: n = 4, rounds = [1,3,1,2] Output: [1,2]
// Input: n = 7, rounds = [1,3,5,7] Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
